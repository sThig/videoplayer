This lesson by Wes, I think things are sticking a bit better.  I was able to understand a lot more and actually really enjoyed this one.  I did, however get confused by the math but that's nothing new


## TIL

* reinforced querySelectorAll and querySelector
* reinforced Event Listeners
* reinforced ES6 syntax
* better familiarity with gitHub flow

Today was a good day
